This problem is inherently ill-posed since a multiplicity of solutions exist for any given low-resolution pixel. 
In other words, it is an underdetermined inverse problem, of which solution is not unique. 
Such a problem is typically mitigated（减轻，缓和） by constraining the solution space by strong prior information.
